Advanced Predictive Modeling Techniques for Marketing Analytics: A Comparative Analysis of Poisson and Negative Binomial Distributions in Consumer Behavior Prediction

# Poisson Model: 
I use the billboard dataset to estimate model parameters using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), predict exposure counts, and visualize the results.
# Negative Binomial Distribution (NBD) Model: 
Similarly, this model uses the same dataset to provide a comparative analysis against the Poisson model, aiming to determine which model better fits the data.
# Poisson Regression and NBD Regression: 
These are applied to the khakichinos dataset to predict and analyze purchase behavior, comparing both regression models to identify the more effective approach in different scenarios.
